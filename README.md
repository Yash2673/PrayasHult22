Prayas helps emerging brands make the best use of available data, and enter the Food Supply Chain effectively. Established brands can offset losses, by improving regional sales in poorly-performing markets.

We achieve this by using Data Science, where we plotted heat maps for various area based on the data collected from Prayas Pilots and thus provide the most crucial data required by the emerging brands to rise in this saturated market.
